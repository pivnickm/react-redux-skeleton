# React-Redux Skeleton Project

With the help of Greg, this skeleton has been set up so I can learn and play with React and Redux. That's all.

## Getting Started

You need webpack and webpack-dev-server:

```
npm install -g webpack webpack-dev-server
```

Locally, you need to run npm install like any other project:

```
npm install
```

Then to build:

```
webpack --progress --colors
```

Or to build and run:

```
webpack-dev-server --progress --colors
```
